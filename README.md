# SAFe
I use this Google Function to help me during my training for the SAFe Certification. 
The purpose of this GFunction is to parse the result page of a SAFe training session, check if the answer is Good and then store it in a Collection on Firstore.

## Next Step 
- Store the data in a Temp collection
- Create a new GFunction that will store new questions in a definitive collection and update the existing one if needed
- Create a front to upload the SAFe training result page
- Create a front for training
